# Digital_System_Design

This repository contains 9 fundamental digital design implementations using Verilog HDL. These modules serve as building blocks for sequential and combinational circuits, commonly used in digital electronics and FPGA-based projects.

**Repository Structure**

Each folder contains the corresponding Verilog source code along with testbenches.

 **Included Modules:**
 
1️ Frequency Divider - Reduces the clock frequency for timing control.

2️ JK Flip-Flop using SR Flip-Flop - Implements a JK Flip-Flop using SR Flip-Flop logic.

3️ Johnson Counter - A ring counter with feedback for sequential logic applications.

4️ Non-Overlapping Sequence Detector - Detects a specific bit sequence without overlap.

5️ Overlapping Sequence Detector - Detects a specific bit sequence with overlap.

6️ SR Flip-Flop - Implements a basic Set-Reset Flip-Flop.

7️ SR Latch - A fundamental bistable memory element.

8️ Shift Register - A sequential circuit used for data storage and transfer.

9️ Up/Down Counter - A counter that increments or decrements based on control input.
